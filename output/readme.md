# `output` folder

You can place as many languages as you'd like to translate all in a single run of the script.

_For example:_ place an empty `es.json` to translate the `json` from the `source_of_truth` folder.

_Note:_ filenames need to be in the [ISO-639 code](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages) format.
